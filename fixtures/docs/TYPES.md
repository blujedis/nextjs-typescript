## NextJS Typescript (TYPES)

<a href="MAIN.md">&larr; MENU</a>

The "Types" directory provides a location for global Typescript types. In most cases we find it's best to keep types with the primary component or helper of use. However this doesn't make sense in some cases hence this directory is used for this case.
